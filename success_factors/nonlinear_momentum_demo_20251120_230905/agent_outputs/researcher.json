  "thought_process": "I noticed that simple momentum often fails in high volatility regimes. By normalizing momentum with volatility, we can create a more robust signal.",
  "code_explanation": "The custom code calculates a 21-day rolling mean and divides it by the 21-day rolling standard deviation."
